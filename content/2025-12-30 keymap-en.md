Original (single source of truth): [Chinese](./2025-12-26%20keymap.md).

Let me introduce my 30-key, thumb-less keymap from scratch, and explain how it all falls into place. To simplify the explanation, I’ll use the Planck layout because it’s Ortholinear. In reality, I don’t use a Planck. For every section, I will try to cite some **Alternative Options**.

**Ultimate Goals:**
- 30 Keys
- No thumb keys
- No combinations involving more than two keys
- Don't give up the mouse
- IME Numbers (for CJK users)

I do not recommend QMK or ZMK keyboards to anyone—whether you are a complete novice who knows nothing about keyboards, or a veteran skilled in keyboard programming. Kanata is free and can apply all the techniques mentioned in this article: <https://github.com/jtroo/kanata>.

## Let's Start by Drawing a Grid

This is a basic 30-key layout, ignoring specific column or row staggering. The most important work done here is deciding where the Homing keys go.

![grid](/asset/keymap/grid.png)

```json
[{"css":"@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter+Tight:400,700');\n* {\n  font-family: 'Inter Tight';\n}"},
[{"a":0},"","","","","",{"x":0.5},"","","","",""],
["","","",{"n":true},"","",{"x":0.5},"",{"n":true},"","","",""],
["","","","","",{"x":0.5},"","","","",""]]
```

**Alternative Options:** Too many to count. The most famous Alternative Option is the classic 104 Keys (also known as the Standard Keyboard or 100% Keyboard).

I’m discussing classic layouts here rather than the well-known three-thumb-key designs (like the Corne: <https://github.com/foostan/crkbd>) for the same reason people in the Backrooms (<https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/faq#toc1>) talk about the Frontrooms (<https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/the-frontrooms>).

I could, of course, go on listing some trendy layouts, but to be honest, using these layouts hasn't made me any happier than using a standard keyboard. My hand movement has indeed decreased, but I’ve become more accustomed to a sedentary lifestyle, and the health damage from sitting for long periods is immense. After using split keyboards for over four years, I’m starting to struggle to find the meaning behind my original opposition to standard keyboards. But as of writing this, I still haven't found it. For the ZMK and QMK users reading this far—that's not what you're here for, is it?

> [!CAUTION]
> Please make better choices than the ones I did.

## Deciding the Alpha Arrangement

The word "Layout" has many meanings, so I’m going to avoid using it.

I chose QWERTY because there’s no special reason not to. The only difference from standard QWERTY is that I swapped the colon with the quote mark because I feel the latter is used more frequently.

![alpha](/asset/keymap/alpha.png)

```json
[{"css":"@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter+Tight:400,700');\n* {\n  font-family: 'Inter Tight';\n}"},
[{"a":7},"Q","W","E","R","T",{"x":0.5},"Y","U","I","O","P"],
["A","S","D",{"n":true},"F","G",{"x":0.5},"H",{"n":true},"J","K","L",{"a":5},"\"\n\n\n\n\n\n'"],
[{"a":7},"Z","X","C","V","B",{"x":0.5},"N","M",{"a":5},"<\n\n\n\n\n\n,",">\n\n\n\n\n\n.","?\n\n\n\n\n\n/"]]
```

If you’re curious, here are some relatively famous Alternative Options: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout>, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak>. For CJK readers, I need to remind you: You need an IME (Input Method Editor), so think twice before switching.

## Arranging Modifier Keys

Simply put, modifier keys are Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and Gui (on Windows, this is the Windows key). Wikipedia explanation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_key>.

If you’re used to having modifiers in the corners, that’s fine; just leave them there. The price you pay is pinky pain, or difficulty pressing combinations like `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` (because your hand has to contort to reach them). Since this is a 30-key setup, we definitely have to sacrifice the hold functions of certain letter keys to act as modifiers. It is generally accepted that the Home Row keys (`ASDF JKL;`) are prime real estate, so we assign the hold function of these keys to modifiers. This arrangement is called **Home Row Mods**.

Stating this covers the minimum threshold of knowledge for the reader. For more, refer to <https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods>.

### Home Row Mods

#### Placement

Here I’ve arranged ACS: Alt, Ctrl, Shift from left to right. The right hand mirrors this arrangement because, in standard touch typing, the area responsible for each finger is fixed. Gui (I only use Windows here, so it’s the Windows key) will be mentioned in a moment.

![acs](/asset/keymap/acs.png)

```json
[{"css":"@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter+Tight:400,700');\n* {\n  font-family: 'Inter Tight';\n}"},
[{"a":7},"Q","W","E","R","T",{"x":0.5},"Y","U","I","O","P"],
["A",{"a":5},"\nLAlt\n\n\n\n\nS","\nLCtrl\n\n\n\n\nD",{"n":true},"\nLShift\n\n\n\n\nF",{"a":7},"G",{"x":0.5},"H",{"a":5,"n":true},"\nLShift\n\n\n\n\nJ","\nLCtrl\n\n\n\n\nK","\nLAlt\n\n\n\n\nL","\"\n\n\n\n\n\n'"],
[{"a":7},"Z","X","C","V","B",{"x":0.5},"N","M",{"a":5},"<\n\n\n\n\n\n,",">\n\n\n\n\n\n.","?\n\n\n\n\n\n/"]]
```

Readers are, of course, free to arrange modifiers on the Home Row however they like, distributing them based on their own frequency of use in programs. I initially based this on Miryoku (<https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference>). The only one I need to mention specifically is Ctrl. By placing Ctrl on D, you can execute `Ctrl + A` (Select All), `Ctrl + S` (Save), and `Ctrl + F` (Find) with one hand. The only sacrifice is `Ctrl + D`. No other position offers such high value.

 regarding placement, as long as Ctrl is on D, the trade-offs of other arrangements seem to be much of a muchness (or have minimal impact).

#### The Cost of Home Row Mods Themselves

The biggest Trade-off of Home Row Mods is accidental triggers (misfires), followed by (artificially introduced) typing latency. I don't know much about QMK, but I hear they have this <https://github.com/stasmarkin/sm_td>, which introduces complex conditional judgment to improve it into a perfect Home Row Mod that allows both fluid typing and functionality. For ZMK, use <https://github.com/urob/zmk-config?tab=readme-ov-file#timeless-homerow-mods>. I know even less about Kanata.

**Alternative Options:** Keymaps that don’t use Home Row Mods can be found here: <https://keymapdb.com/?hasHomeRowMods=false>. Generally, the approaches are:

-   This article doesn’t use thumb keys, but you can use thumb keys to place Mods directly. Intuitively, this is the most convenient. Trade-off: You can’t use thumb keys for layer switching.
-   Create a Mod Layer: <https://keymapdb.com/keymaps/callum_oakley/>. Trade-off: Intuitively inconvenient. On a standard keyboard, `Ctrl + C` requires pressing two keys. With a Mod Layer, you have to switch layers, select the Mod, and then press the key you want. Switching layers adds a keystroke, meaning you need to use `Ctrl + {nav} + C` to press `Ctrl + C`.
-   Use Combos as Modifiers. Trade-off: Same problem as above, but balanced a bit, because once you get used to it, pressing two keys together intuitively feels like one key. The biggest Trade-off is getting used to it, which is harder than the previous two.
-   Use a Leader Key (ZMK implementation: <https://github.com/urob/zmk-leader-key>) and then do Sticky Keys or Key Toggles. This is friendly for God Mode (<https://github.com/emacsorphanage/god-mode>) or Meow (<https://github.com/meow-edit/meow>) users. Trade-off: Basically includes all the above Trade-offs, except for Home Row Mods themselves.

### Windows Key

As mentioned, there are four modifiers: Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Gui. On Windows, Gui is the Windows key. But the Windows key is special because it's effectively hijacked by Microsoft—e.g., `Win + L` to lock, `Win + X` for the menu, `Win + R` to run. It's hard for other programs to use this key. On Windows, you can bind keys not used by Microsoft, but it's hard to rebind one that is, like `Win + L` (which even uses the Home Row L).

After some thought, I realized I rarely use this key. I never use `Win + L` or `Win + X`. I use "Everything" to replace `Win + R`. I use "Ditto" to replace `Win + V`. I rarely use `Win + E`, and I feel `explorer.exe` is slow. I use the IME to input Emojis (`Win + ;` or just the period key), and the IME handles switching English/Chinese (`Win + Space`). So, I kicked it right off the Home Row and placed it on C.

```

Putting it on C is for when I might need `Win + V` on a new system or in god-knows-what situation. A reasonable Alternative is the V key. But the next section explains why it wasn't ultimately placed on V.

### Composite Modifiers

Once, I saw this article: <https://blog.getreu.net/20250826-muscle-memory-friendly-home-row-mods>. Although my arrangement differs from his, he has an interesting point: V is a sub-optimal position for the Home Row. That is, pressing *down* (inward) is much easier than pressing *up* (outward). Naturally, I thought of arranging composite modifiers to achieve my goal of "not using more than two keys." Starting with Ctrl, since F is already `LShift`, and V is below F, I assigned `LCtrl + LShift` to V.

I could have assigned `LCtrl + LAlt` to the X key, but I didn't, because something more important took that spot (parentheses, mentioned later). Also, I use `LCtrl + LAlt` less often. So, for the harder-to-press upper section, I arranged Alt—for example, on the R key, I assigned `LAlt + LShift`, and then assigned `LCtrl + LAlt` to E. Last, add `LMeh` (`LCtrl + LShift + LAlt`) for the upper key of `LAlt`.

```

There are a huge number of **Alternative Options** for this part. I need to mention: be careful with keys in the index finger area. If you assign a hold function to the index finger area, for one-handed typing, you are actually sacrificing five (5) keys, not two (2).

## Layers

This is another tool to achieve the "single-hand mouse" goal. You don't have to be as careful as before, because you can freely improvise. I change layers often, so I'll only show the basics or the things that don't change.

### Navigation (nav)

The most important thing is the Arrow keys, followed by HOME, END, PGDN, PGUP. Arrow keys semantically allow for long presses, but other nav keys don't, so the urgent task is to arrange the Arrow keys in a convenient position.

**Alternative Option: Vim-style Arrow Keys.**

Arranging arrow keys basically splits into two schools of thought: the Vim school and the Arrow Key school. The Vim school arranges arrows horizontally (like Miryoku arranging `JKL;` as Left-Down-Up-Right, or you could do `HJKL`), which makes the arrows act like `WASD` in games. I personally don't like using Vim, and its Alternative Option, Helix, isn't mature yet, so I ultimately chose the Arrow Key school (plus, there's no room to arrange keys horizontally anyway). Comparing the Trade-offs: The Vim school only sacrifices a tiny bit of inertia cost, but the gain is being able to press Up and Down faster (theoretically). The price of the Arrow Key layout is using one finger to control both Up and Down, leading to uneven distribution of key pressure.

I previously tried using rotating Arrow Key Combos for navigation: `ES` for Up, `SC` for Left, `CF` for Down, `FE` for Right. I tried it for a month; the final conclusion was that it wasn't worth it.

### Arranging Numbers (`num`)

As mentioned earlier, pressing down is easier than pressing up. Adhering to the "single hand as much as possible" constraint, I assigned Z as the number layer toggle (instead of Q).

```json

```

The layout here is Numpad, meaning numbers are arranged in a 3x3 grid (the position of 0 is less important). **Alternative Options: Numrow.** Numpad arranges numbers by position, while Numrow arranges them by semantics (increasing from left to right). There are several designs, but all assume you are using the Home Row.

-   Use the standard Numrow, like on a normal keyboard. Intuitively optimal, and I personally think it has a lower cognitive load. Trade-off: Imbalance between semantics and frequency. Generally, 1 and 0 are frequently typed numbers, but they are assigned to the pinky finger. However, this doesn't matter to those who are used to it.
    ![numrow](/asset/keymap/numrow.png)
-   Use frequency-corrected Numrow, like <https://keymapdb.com/keymaps/callum_oakley/>. Place 1 and 0 on the index finger, then odd numbers on the left hand, even on the right. Trade-off: Weakens semantics slightly compared to the option above.
    ![numrow-s](/asset/keymap/numrow-s.png)

I need to remind you that I’ve ignored modifier keys here. In reality, you need to consider how to press `Ctrl + 1`. But this is also easily solved: place the Right Hand Row below the Left Hand Row, because pressing down is always easier than pressing up anyway.

-   You can also use Combos to input numbers, whether vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Trade-off: Impossible to type at high speeds, and habitually, typing numbers shouldn't be slower than typing letters. A balance needs to be struck.

### Arranging Symbols (`sym`)

Naturally, arranging a symbol layer symmetrical to the left hand becomes logical, because `Shift + Number` inputs a bunch of symbols.

![sym](/asset/keymap/sym.png)

```json
[{"css":"@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter+Tight:400,700');\n* {\n  font-family: 'Inter Tight';\n}"},
[{"x":-3.75,"a":0},"","",{"a":7},"LA+LC","LA+LS",{"a":0},"",{"x":0.5},"",{"a":7},"&","*","(",{"a":0},""],
[{"x":-3.75},"",{"a":7},"LAlt","LCtrl",{"n":true},"LShift",{"a":0},"",{"x":0.5},"",{"a":7,"n":true},"$","%","^",{"a":0},""],
[{"x":-3.75},"","",{"a":7},"<svg width='16' height='16' viewBox='0 0 640 640' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><path d='M96 157.7L279.6 132.4L279.6 309.8L96 309.8L96 157.7zM96 482.3L279.6 507.6L279.6 332.4L96 332.4L96 482.3zM299.8 510.3L544 544L544 332.4L299.8 332.4L299.8 510.3zM299.8 129.7L299.8 309.8L544 309.8L544 96L299.8 129.7z'/></svg>","LC+LS",{"a":0},"",{"x":0.5,"a":7},")","!","@","#",{"g":true},"/"]]
```

Symbols are different from numbers, because numbers are Semantics vs. Position, but symbols themselves don't have much semantic order (even if they do internally). So for symbols, the Alternative Options are **Sensory vs. Frequency**. `Shift + Numpad` considers the sensory aspect because it aligns with the number layer on the left. Frequency involves many specific arrangements, because everyone’s character input frequency varies wildly—some people will never type `$` or `*` in their lives. Anyway, just a brief mention here: if you see someone else's symbol map and it looks chaotic, try to understand it in terms of frequency, then consider why it was placed there. The Trade-off when comparing these two is the opposite of whichever you choose, so I won't belabor the point.

#### Arranging Rolling Symbols (`roll`)

Some symbols have semantics that differ from others, for example, parentheses. Placing them above 9 and 0 is obviously unreasonable here, because a normal person would press `Shift` then press 9 and roll to 0 to type a pair of parentheses. The same goes for `[]` and `{}`. So, we can create a separate layer for these.

![roll](/asset/keymap/roll.png)

```json
[{"css":"@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter+Tight:400,700');\n* {\n  font-family: 'Inter Tight';\n}"},
[{"a":0},"","",{"a":7},"{","}",{"a":0},"",{"x":0.5},"",{"a":7},"LA+LS","LA+LC",{"a":0},"",""],
["","",{"a":7},"(",{"n":true},")",{"a":0},"",{"x":0.5},"",{"a":7,"n":true},"LShift","LCtrl","LAlt",{"a":0},""],
["",{"g":true,"a":7},"X",{"g":false},"[","]",{"a":0},"",{"x":0.5},"",{"a":7},"LC+LS","<svg width='16' height='16' viewBox='0 0 640 640' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><path d='M96 157.7L279.6 132.4L279.6 309.8L96 309.8L96 157.7zM96 482.3L279.6 507.6L279.6 332.4L96 332.4L96 482.3zM299.8 510.3L544 544L544 332.4L299.8 332.4L299.8 510.3zM299.8 129.7L299.8 309.8L544 309.8L544 96L299.8 129.7z'/></svg>",{"a":0},"",""]]
```

**Alternative Options:** The rival to Roll is Symmetry—placing one parenthesis on the left hand and one on the right. <https://keymapdb.com/keymaps/callum_oakley/> does this. The Trade-off is self-evident.

### Arranging Function (`fun`) Keys

An F-Row is impossible within these 30 keys, and there are no thumb keys. I realized I never long-press numbers, so I decided to set the long-press of numbers as Function Keys. Don't worry too much about F12; you can use a Combo for that.

![funtion](/asset/keymap/function.png)

```json
[{"css":"@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter+Tight:400,700');\n* {\n  font-family: 'Inter Tight';\n}"},
[{"a":0},"",{"a":5},"\nF7\n\n\n\n\n7","\nF8\n\n\n\n\n8","\nF9\n\n\n\n\n9",{"a":7},"F12",{"x":0.5,"a":0},"",{"a":7},"LA+LS","LA+LC",{"a":0},"",""],

```

### Finally

If you need to adjust lighting, you can arrange an RGB (`rgb`) Layer. But I currently don't have that need.

I originally needed to set up a system `sys` layer, but since I change it so much, I won't write it down. I need to remind you that at the very least, you should set keys to switch Bluetooth devices or a Bootloader key.

## Arranging Combos

There are some very important keys that don't seem to fit anywhere mentioned above. So, Combos come in handy here. Note that:

**Symmetry is meaningless.** Mirroring left-hand combos to the right hand is semantically inconsistent for me. Because I primarily use the mouse. When I use the right-hand part of the keyboard, I expect to switch to "Full Keyboard Mode." So the semantics of the left hand and the right hand are inconsistent in my view. That is why I arranged Rolling on X but not on Dot.

### Delete and Bksp

These two are where it all started. Copied from Artsey.

![bksp-del](/asset/keymap/bksp-del.png)

### Home Row Combo

Not a new thing. However, I need to remind you: The semantics of the Home Row are important here.

The order of `ESC`, `Tab`, `Space` from left to right is copied from Miryoku.

![homerow-combo-left](/asset/keymap/homerow-combo-left.png)

The Right Hand Home Row has symbols because, as mentioned, when using both hands, I should be typing, which means switching from Mouse Mode to Full Keyboard Mode.
![homerow-combo-right](/asset/keymap/homerow-combo-right.png)

### Minus, Under, Equal, Plus

Use the opposing semantics of Minus and Plus. Then move the Combo upwards to type their variants, Under and Equal. Also, Equal is right below Minus, which is especially useful in places that use `Ctrl + =`.

![minus-plus](/asset/keymap/minus-plus.png)

### Tilde to Pipe

Using separated Combos.

![to-pipe](/asset/keymap/to-pipe.png)

### IME Numbers

Many people like to switch layers to input numbers, which is great for those who don't use an IME. I believe even IME users use the number layer to select words. But I wanted an instant solution. Combos are instant; just one extra key press. After getting used to it, it feels no different from pressing a single key. The Numbers here have absolutely no semantics; they are just for selecting words.

![num-combo](/asset/keymap/num-combo.png)

I also want to instantly input Heading 3 in Markdown.

![shift-num-combo](/asset/keymap/shift-num-combo.png)

There are only two **Alternative Options** for IME Numbers Combos:
- Use vertical Combos. Trade-off: Causes confusion in finger responsibility areas and might twist your hand.
- Use diagonal Combos. Trade-off: Even harder to press than number layers, horizontal combos, or vertical combos.

## Entrances And Exits:

### Entrances

If you finished reading this and found it interesting, you can use a Sofle or Corne. I believe you can build it yourself (Domestic and International) or find a cheap Vendor (Domestic only).

### Exits

I believe many people are actually already using QMK and ZMK, have established fixed Keymaps, and only came here to see someone else's Write-up. I just want to remind you again whether this is worth it. Thinking about Keymaps and improving Keymaps consumed a lot of my time, time that might have been better spent soaking up the sun for the health of my hands. I need to mention that I am very grateful to the QMK and ZMK contributors and maintainers, and I respect them greatly. But in terms of means and ends, I unfortunately chose the former, and hollowly passed my 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd years.
