I’ve been tinkering with computers for like 8 years now, but honestly, my skill level isn't much different from someone who just touched a keyboard for the first time. Back in high school, I installed Arch (my first Linux distro). In college, after hopping through Fedora and Linux Mint, Arch was still the one I stuck with the longest. Back then, I really felt like my computer ran faster. I stumbled upon a lot of interesting software—though I’ve forgotten their names by now. I also learned about software philosophies; they're like a persona for software, sometimes bordering on stereotypes. But I’ve forgotten what they were called, too. The one that stuck with me most was "do one thing and do it well."

Usually, this is the part where the writer pivots to "Why I switched back to Windows." I’m not going to discuss why I switched to Windows here; that’s a topic for [another post](/content/2025-12-17%20linux.md) (you can check it out, it’s really short!). Anyway, when I was daily driving Linux, I was genuinely shocked by that `explorer.exe` that never hangs. I didn't realize I had a self-control "skill issue"—I’d always end up debugging some random bug until midnight. I was on barebones i3 back then. I never got tired; I thought it was fun.

I kept this up right until finals week. As luck would have it, that semester allowed for all assignments to be piled up and done during finals week. The result? I realized my current desktop environment setup wasn't actually robust enough to handle schoolwork. That was another manifestation of the self-control skill issue.

I’m not here to lecture you about "production first, config second." I did eventually realize that—metaphysically speaking—later on. I found that Linux desktop environments bugging out was just a daily occurrence (this was back in the Xorg days). So, my strategy became: dual boot, do actual work on Windows. Then one day, I realized I didn't have a single important file on the Linux partition. So I just formatted it.

While I was formatting it, a memory popped up. My parents walked over and asked, "Son, can you save this photo for me?" Technically, it's just a file transfer. But my brain immediately jumped to: "Linux would move this faster," and "The drive better be exFAT."

This month, Wayland development seemed to have matured, so I installed Fedora again. Before that, I was torn between Arch and Fedora, but the LLM told me Fedora manages laptop battery life better, so I went with that. I was finally able to do something different than usual—I rushed to download Zed (the GUI is finally somewhat usable now). Then I installed Niri. I started marveling at how great Niri’s infinite scrollable WM is—no BSP, no column-only, no manual tiling. Then, because of the reason mentioned in that other article, I formatted the Linux partition again.

I haven't found a job yet. I realized I actually need to get one. But these jobs sometimes conflict with the time I spend messing with my computer (I don't play video games, see the other article). This makes me somewhat resentful of jobs that don't involve computers. This counts as a skill issue: I haven't got my mindset right.

While I was at home tinkering with the PC, tweaking my Neovim config, my family came over to remind me to eat more fruit. Once, I opened a book written in Chinese, and a family member walked by and remarked, "Finally, something in Chinese that you can actually understand."

I asked myself: Am I truly happy playing with Linux, or tweaking Neovim configs, or learning these new concepts right now? The answer is no. But back then, the answer was yes. And back then, I never even wasted time asking myself that question.
