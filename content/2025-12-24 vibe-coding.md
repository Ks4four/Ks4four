TL;DR: I deleted the raw things because while I stand by the idea, I cannot ethically endorse the implementation.

I am an ESL speaker. To be honest, I used AI to write code first, then I learned the word "vibe coding". But I also don't want to learn programming, because I have many bills to pay, and my interest is not big enough to make me learn programming. I only hope AI can give me code that works. Like I said in [Why I don't use emacs](/content/2025-12-21%20emacs.md), between technology and product, I chose product.

One time I saw this [tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/exwife-of-frankenstein/797555741346217984/youtube-is-full-of-ads-spotify-is-full-of-ads?source=share). And unconsciously I thought of [this tweet](https://x.com/aramh/status/1944416910214312253). I never used Docker, so I don't have the right to speak about whether "Docker made our engineering quality lower" is true. But I think AI coding might really make our engineering quality go down. When I think about this point, and think about the word foreseeability, I feel some kind of shame. Actually I think I have innovative ideas for some functions, but I don't need to show AI-written code. I like the idea of programming, but I don't respect AI's implementation. I think in order to not let engineering (or some small communities like jwno) get enshittified, deleting AI code becomes more and more important. So I deleted it. I feel this is not very noble thing to do, but I feel doing this is correct. So, this is basically the reason you navigated here. At first I wanted something that can just run, not to harm the community, or harm devs, or harm people I never met but want to learn programming.

You might say, "Future LLMs will be much better! They will write better code!" The problem is, you cannot use "you could have done better" to refute a system that doesn't require you to do better. When a system allows people to be sloppy, people will be sloppy. I have experienced this deeply.
