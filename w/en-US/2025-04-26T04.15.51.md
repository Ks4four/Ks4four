I'm not a fan of any operating system, nor do I wish to become attached to any programming language.

Whenever I have to use a computer, I feel a mix of disgust and pain: a machine barely half a cubic metre in volume ends up consuming far too much of my time. Computers are, of course, the crystallization of human wisdom, but they still need humans to control them; from another perspective, they drag us in front of their screens. Even so-called ‘unattended’ operations are nothing but `if`-`else` trees—if the human doesn’t satisfy that condition, the computer does nothing.

I used Linux for a while, and I’m grateful for the experience: after countless distribution swaps, attempts to fix nameless, unmaintained, and undocumented software bugs through language learning, and watching desktop environments break for no reason, I realized I didn’t enjoy this supposedly _free_ system at all. Every distro is imperfect, and I'm too lazy; that laziness is exactly what the community loves to label *consumerist*, *entitled*, and improper. Feeling guilty, I constantly tried to learn what they call _common sense_. Honestly, there was nothing “common” about it—I even wrote several Linux notes about it. I devoted far too much time to this freedom. Soon, every time I ran an application, binary, or even just opened a terminal, I felt my life slipping away bit by bit.

Windows isn't better. Though everyone says it’s user-friendly (and it is), users still have to endure its various mysterious Microsoft _gifts_: lag spikes, vanishing `env` and `$PATH` variables, and the occasional death of `explorer.exe`. Worse, Windows failures often have no identifiable cause. Although losing `env` and `$PATH` might not bother ordinary users who never touch the command line, for a half-baked tech enthusiast[^1] like me, arrogance and vanity compel me to dig into every issue. In the end, this also consumes enormous amounts of time. I never knew I could become so focused on wasting my life.

macOS? Out of my price range.

Although I'm _slightly_ more capable than the average user and might be called a "computer expert", which really just means I can read English READMEs, follow the manual, and attempt to fix problems myself, encountering these things doesn't bring me joy. Whenever people discuss how powerful `vim`/`neovim` or `emacs` are, I follow the trend, download them, and stare at a jungle of incomprehensible shortcuts. I’ve tried to learn them, but why bother? They're merely command sequences for a few programs, miles away from genuine *productivity*.

The truth embarrasses me: I don’t like new things. I touch a computer only when there’s no other choice. For several months, I didn't bring my computer home, only a smartphone, and was shocked to discover my family was aging much faster than any compilation progress bar. I travelled with close friends and realized computers can’t provide that kind of joy—or rather, I couldn’t find meaning in *controlling* them. For many people (especially those who create impressive software), life and computer use aren't in conflict; but for an ordinary person like me, who barely understands a “real” programming languages (Markdown hardly counts), I simply don’t see the appeal. Given the choice, I’d socialize and make new friends rather than sit here, waiting for a build that may or may not succeed.

Forgive my extreme views; computers don’t intentionally categorize people. It's just that when people aren't under economic pressure, they can pour energy into ingenious software; when survival consumes that energy, a computer is good for little more than passive entertainment. Perhaps that’s the "rich get richer" phenomenon[^2].

I now run the latest Windows build. Opening **Settings**[^3] and swapping in an anime-girl wallpaper is the best damage control I’ve found. By the way, I remember productivity wallpapers—those with solid colors or "focused themes" with a few words—were once popular, but a colorful desktop reminds me the machine can still be harmless.

Call it [PEBKAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error) if you like. Yes, I’m _unskilled_, but I’d sooner get up from the chair than polish skills that won’t move me up in the world.
